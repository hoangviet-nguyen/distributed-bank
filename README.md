# Exercises – Distributed Systems

This project contains a sample implementation of the distributed systems exercises provided by **FHNW**.

The original exercises were designed as **Java-only applications**.  
For learning purposes, this repository extends the implementation with:

- a **web-based user interface**
- **TypeScript clients** for interacting with the system
- a **Java server** to explore backend technologies and distributed concepts

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to:

- deepen understanding of **distributed systems**
- gain practical experience with **Java backend development**
- learn **TypeScript and web-based client integration**
- explore how different technologies interact in a **full-stack distributed setup**
